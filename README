This is a super simple, no feature theme for WordPress, based on the Shape theme by Ian Stewart and the HTML5 Boilerplate from Paul Irish.

The entire idea is have a jumping off point for theme creation. This theme get's you started with a few basic layouts, the correct pages and things to make a WordPress theme work, support for a header menu through WordPress and all the HTML5 and CSS3 wonderfulness you can muster. It uses the jQuery loaded in through WordPress and has all the necessary stuff to work in the WordPress environment.

Use and abuse to your pleasure
